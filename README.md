 ## Welcome to The History Navigator
 Here's an explanation on how the app works
 
1. **Input Age:** The app starts with a simple interface where users can input their age. Users can do this by tapping on the EditText field labeled "Enter Your Age" and typing in their age using the numeric keypad on their device.

2. **Generate History:** After entering their age, users can tap the "Generate History" button. This action triggers the app to process the user's input and generate a list of historical figures who passed away around the specified age.

3. **Display Historical Figures:** Once the list is generated, the app displays a series of historical figures along with brief summaries of their lives and achievements. Each historical figure is presented in a visually appealing format, making it easy for users to read and explore.

4. **Explore and Learn:** Users can scroll through the list of historical figures to explore the individuals who passed away around their age. They can read the summaries to learn more about each figure's background, contributions to history, and significance.

5. **Clear and Retry:** If users want to input a different age or start over, they can tap the "Clear" button. This action clears the age input field and the displayed list of historical figures, allowing users to enter a new age and generate a new list.

6. **Error Handling:** The app includes robust error handling mechanisms to guide users in providing valid age inputs. If users enter an age outside the specified range (15 to 100) or fail to input their age altogether, clear and informative error messages are displayed to ensure a smooth user experience.

Overall, the History Navigator app offers a user-friendly and engaging way for users to explore historical figures based on their age. By leveraging the app's intuitive interface and curated list of historical figures, users can delve into the rich tapestry of history and discover the stories of remarkable individuals who shaped the world we live in today.
